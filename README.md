# Mjishu-book

## Description
This is Mjishu Book! My take on different social media apps with all of the core functionality.

## Why?
The **motivation** behind this app was directed by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com),
and **came to life** under the belief that: *If im using something so often in my life shouldn't I know what goes into it*?
The purpose of this app was to answer just that!

## Quick Start
Viewing the app is as simple as clicking the [link](https://mjishu-book.onrender.com/) here!
